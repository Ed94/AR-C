# LAR (Layer Abstracted Refactorable)
A little project to test a concept for programming.

## Alias Sets:
Allow for all key's used during parsing to be mapped to an alias for use of foreign language that LAR's functionality could support if a key sutiably matches the original's function.

These mappings are saved as an alias set.
